# Encrypt
Playing around when i was just starting 12th and learnt about dat files and learnt that i could extract the raw data from them as a string.

The try_clean_encrypt_non_indipendent was made in a day  in Sep 2024 to try to impliment what i read in the book "Clean code - Robert C Martin" for the first time.

Run/open the try_clean_encrypt_non_indipendent.py
